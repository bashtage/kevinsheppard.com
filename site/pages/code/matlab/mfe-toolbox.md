The Oxford MFE Toolbox is the follow on to the [UCSD\_GARCH](/code/matlab/ucsd-garch/)
toolbox. It has been widely used by students here at Oxford, and represents a
substantial improvement in robustness over the original UCSD GARCH code,
although in its current form it only contains univariate routines.

## Current Version

The latest version, including any work in progress, can be downloaded on
the [GitHub repository for the MFE Toolbox](https://github.com/bashtage/mfe-toolbox/)
([Direct link to zip](https://github.com/bashtage/mfe-toolbox/archive/master.zip)).

### Last Updated 

June 7, 2013

### Update News

Many changes have occurred since the last release. The most notable are:

-   A major rework of the subsampling in the Realized code
-   Modern versions of BEKK (Scalar, Diagonal and Full) and RARCH, a
    recent model by Diaa Noureldin, Neil Sheppard and me.
-   DCC, BEKK and HEAVY are all finally available in this toolbox, and
    so the retirement of the UCSD GARCH toolbox is almost ready.
-   OGARCH and GOGARCH have been added.
-   RCC, an alternative to DCC, is also available (by Diaa Noureldin,
    Neil Sheppard and Kevin Sheppard).

The next developments should include the TODO include:

-   SARIMA
-   Clean up of unused files and more coherent naming

### Functions Missing from Previous UCSD GARCH Toolbox

The following list of function have not been updated and so if needed,
you should continue to use the [UCSD GARCH](/code/matlab/ucsd-garch/) code.

-   GARCH in mean
-   IDCC MVGARCH
-   Shapirowilks
-   Shapirofrancia
