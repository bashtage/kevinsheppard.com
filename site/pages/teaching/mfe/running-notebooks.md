The mfe package is one I use to prepare the slides.  It is not polished, but I am happy to
share it so that you can install it on your computer.  This is not a requirement, but is necessary
if you want to run the notebook code I have shared.

1. Download the [MFE package](/files/teaching/mfe/mfe-1.0.tar.gz) to your computer and made note of the download location.
2. Install the package using `pip`.  You can do this inside IPython or Jupyter by entering the command

```
%pip install <full-path-to>/mfe-1.0.tag.gz
```

`<full-path-to>` should be the path to the gzip. Windows users should usually place `mfe-1.0.tag.gz` in the same directory
as the Jupyter notebook so that the package can be installed using 

```
%pip install mfe-1.0.tag.gz
```
