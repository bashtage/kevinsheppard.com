## Course Content

The course covers aspects of financial econometrics including:

* Simulation and Monte Carlo
* Maximum Likelihood Estimation
* Regression and Model Selection
* Linear Time Series Models
* Voltility Modeling
* Value-at-Risk Estimation
* Vector Autoregressions

The course follows an outline and is divided into a large number
of distinct problems.  The problems are grouped into lessons, and
each is available as a blank Jupyter notebook as well as through a
completed notebook. 

### Getting Started
The simplest method to get the course content is to download the [zip of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/bashtage/python-introduction/archive/master.zip).
If you are comfortable with git, you can clone the repo using 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bashtage/python-introduction.git
```
