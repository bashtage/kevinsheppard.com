\begin_layout Standard
This document describes how you can use your phone or tablet to produce
 clear scans of your work as PDF files that are modest in size.
 The final section is written for Trinity Term 2020 open-book test-takers
 since these students may be scanning documents under a tight time constraint.
 If you have any comments of know of software that works better, please
 let me know at

\begin_layout Section*
Flatbed Scanners
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have access to a flatbed scanner, this will produce the highest quality
 scan.
 I recommend you use 300dpi in black and white mode when scanning documents
 for submission.
 This balances file size against the image's resolution.
 Grayscale and color generally produce files that are larger and that are
 not usually easier for assessors or tutors to read.

General Instructions

\begin_layout Subsection*
Lighting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Poor lighting is the simplest method to produce a scan that is hard or impossibl
e to read.
 Side lighting is key to creating a high-quality scan when using a phone
 or tablet.
 Overhead lighting is your enemy since it is likely that your body or your
 device will cast an unnecessary shadow.
 Look around your environment for locations that have a reliable source
 of side lighting.
 When scanning in the day, indirect outside light can produce an excellent
 source for producing high-quality scans.
 Direct sunlight can lead to overexposure and is not recommended.
 Alternatively, you might find locations with under cabinet lighting.
 I have good experience using these.
 Finally, a desk lamp can be positioned to produce side lighting where both
 you and your device will not case a shadow.
 If you do not have a good location with side lighting, you can use your
 device's flash.
 In my experience, this produces slightly worse quality scans than having
 a good lighting setup, but it is much better than having a shadow on your
 document.

 shows a scan created with uniform lighting that originated from the side.
 Figures

\end_inset

 show scans that were produced when the strongest source of light originated
 above the document so that my arm or the device cast a strong shadow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming you are writing on white paper, you want to scan on a background
 that has high contrast.
 Black, dark brown, and most other dark colors produce high contrast, which
 lets the software function better.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:location"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows my preferred scanning location in my home.
 It is a dark kitchen worktop which provides great contrast.
 It is illuminated by under cabinet lighting, and so I cannot cast shadows
 with my body or my device.
 Note that when scanning, I turn off the other lights in the kitchen so
 that the under-counter lights are the strongest source of illumination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Device Position
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important that you hold your device level and that the document occupies
 the majority of the viewfinder when scanning.
 Most high-quality scanning software will encourage optimal camera positioning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Multi-page Documents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most documents you scan will consist of multiple pages.
 You should scan these consecutively by adding a new page to your current
 scan.
 If you make a mistake, I recommend reshooting the problematic page and
 then continuing to the end of the document.
 All of the recommended software lets you delete a page after you finish
 scanning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Software Recommendations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
iOS (iPad/iPhone)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two apps I recommend: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Genius Scan"
target "https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/genius-scan-pdf-scanner/id377672876"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (4.8 rating, 35,000 reviews) and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Scanner Pro"
target "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-pdf-scanner-app/id333710667"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (4.9 rating 130,000 reviews).
 Genius Scan is free and has a paid upgrade.
 It works well enough in the free mode to use for exam and assignment submission.
 Scanner Pro has a modest price.
 Both of these apps have great auto edge detection when used on a high contrast
 background.
 ScannerPro is more forgiving to uneven lighting and tends to produce softer
 shadows if present.
 ScannerPro is my recommendation if the price is not an issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Android 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Genius Scan"
target "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thegrizzlylabs.geniusscan.free&hl=en_GB"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (4.7 rating, 78,000 reviews) is also available for Android and is, in my
 experience, the most accurate scanner.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "CamScanner"
target "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intsig.camscanner&hl=en_GB"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (4.8 rating, 2.5M reviews) also works well, although it is not as accurate
 at automatic edge detection.
 It does have some party trick modes that work well if you have a text that
 is mostly monochrome text but contains a full-color diagram.
 Genius Scan is my recommendation if you have a good lighting setup.
 If not, I would use CamScanner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Genius Scan Settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Set Image Quality to medium before scanning your document (Menu > Settings
 > Image Quality > Medium).
 I Could not detect any relevant differences when scanning black and white
 documents across Medium, High, and Highest.
 File sizes, however, do vary with this setting, and Medium minimizes the
 output size of the PDF without compromising legibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Edit images before exporting.
 After you have scanned the document, you can tap on any page to open the
 edit view.
 Editing lets you: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Adjust the scanning mode to select Black & White if color incorrectly was
 detected; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rotate the images so that they have the correct orientation; and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Recrop any images where GeniusScan's edge detection was not adequate.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Change the 
\emph on
File size
\emph default
 when exporting.
 GeniusScan will 
\series bold
estimate
\series default
 the size of the file after export.
 In my tests, Small produced files that are easy to read (about 600kB per
 scanned page, when used with Medium image quality).
 The table below shows the 
\series bold
estimated
\series default
 size of the file exported using combinations of Image Quality and 
\emph on
File size
\emph default
.
 Medium/Medium and Medium/Large appear to be the most sensible choices.
 Both Highest Image Quality and Actual 
\emph on
File size
\emph default
 should be avoided.

 Note that the file size of the Medium/Small file is 2.5MB, not 1.2MB, as
 estimated by GeniusScan.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Excessively Large Scans
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you attempt to export and the resulting file is excessively large, you
 can split a scan in GeniusScan.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Begin by selecting the document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Long press a page in the second half of the document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Select all pages in the second half.

 illustrates these steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will then need to rejoin the parts into a single PDF using 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

 or an online tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Excessively Large PDFs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the PDF you have produced exceeds the upload limit, you can compress
 it using an 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "online PDF compressor"
target "https://www.ilovepdf.com/compress_pdf"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 I recommend using the most conservative compression (
\emph on

\emph default
) which reduced scanned file sizes by 50% in my experiments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Additional Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I do not believe that at-home exam takers need to be overly concerned with
 carefully formatting their exam answers.
 If pressed for time, it is reasonable to refer a hand-drawn diagram or
 equation on another page.
 If you have time, your assessors will appreciate your efforts to produce
 an easier to read answer.
 If under time pressure and you have two files, combining them into a Zip
 file before uploading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Embedding Images in Documents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When writing essays, you may need one or more diagrams or one or more equations.
 The best format (as in nicest for your tutor or assessor) is to embed the
 image into your word document.
 The simplest method to do this is to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
draw your diagram; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
photograph it;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
crop it tightly on your device; and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
email it to yourself, upload to a file service (Dropbox, Google Drive, or
 OneDrive), or let a service like Google Photos or iCloud to automatically
 back up the photo.
 You can encourage Google photos to back up your images by opening the Google
 photos app.
 The image will then be available 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "through your browser"
target "https://photos.google.com/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should then be able to directly insert the equation or diagram into
 your document without further formatting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Snipping Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Snipping is a simple way to copy anything you can see on your computer into
 a Word or Google docs document.
 You can snip just the content you want, and so should not need to crop
 the image further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows 10: The preferred option is 
\emph on
Snip and Sketch
\emph default
.
 The snipping window can be opened using 
\family typewriter

Command
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Combining PDFs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may have assignments or exams that require mixed answers where some
 questions are standard essays, while others require more calculation.
 If your answer is spread between a Word document or a Google doc and a
 scanned PDF, you should combine these into a single PDF before submission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two simple methods.
 The first uses a web service appropriately titled 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Combine PDF"
target "https://combinepdf.com/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 You can upload two or more PDFs, use drag-and-drop to arrange their order,
 combine them, and then download them.
 This methods comes with a standard disclaimer about privacy.
 Combine PDF states they delete all content after an hour, but they do not
 have a Privacy Policy visible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second uses 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "PDF Sam Basic"
target "https://pdfsam.org/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to merge them.
 PDF Sam is both free to use and open source.
 This program has to be locally installed to use.
 Merging two or more PDFs can be done by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
select merge;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use Add to add each of your files; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
select the output pdf file; and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
click on Run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many other scanners, so please do try others if you are not happy
 with these.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Moving your PDF
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will most likely want to move your scan onto your laptop before uploading
 it to the submission server.
 You must have a good, reliable, and quick method for moving your file out
 of your scanning software.
 I almost always upload to Dropbox (Google Drive and OneDrive are also good

Practice, Practice, and Practice Again

If you are preparing for exams, you must practice with whatever method you
 are going to use.
 You need to practice scanning documents that have sizes that you expect
 to have for your exam, i.e., 10 – 15 pages, depending on your handwriting.
 You should practice until scanning and getting the document off of your
 device until it is second nature.
 The last thing you want is to be stressed in the final minutes of an open
 -book exam.
 You should:

\begin_layout Itemize
know which app you are going to use;

\begin_layout Itemize
know where you will be scanning your paper; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
know how you will get your PDF off of your device; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
have a backup method to get it off your device (e.g., a USB cable to your
 laptop or using a temporary upload service like Firefox Send (

\begin_layout Plain Layout

https://send.firefox.com/
\end_layout

\end_inset

))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should practice the entire process during the University dry-runs.
 Be sure to check the size of the file produced using your preferred method.
 Larger files are more likely may cause difficulties uploading, all things
 equal.

ALWAYS UPLOAD SOMETHING
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are pressed for time and are having any difficulties, you must upload
 any copy, no matter how poor, of your exams before the deadline.
 Your uploaded copy will be inspected, and if it is illegible, then you
 will be asked to upload a better version later.
 The improved copy will be compared to the original submission to verify
 that it contains the same material.
