This course is an introduction to Python and programming aimed at students working
in Finance and Economics. The course is designed to be taught using the Jupyter notebooks
that are in the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bashtage/python-introduction) and
are linked below. The complete course is available for
[download as a pdf](https://github.com/bashtage/python-introduction/raw/master/python-introduction.pdf).

## GitHub

The introduction is available on [Github](https://github.com/bashtage/python-introduction). 
If you are happy to use git, you can download everything
using `git`, or for even fork the repo and save your progress to your own fork.

## Self-paced Study
This course is intended as an alternative to the MATLAB introduction and so
is self-paced.  Each of the lessons is covered in one or more videos that are
available in a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVR_rJLcetzkqoeuhpIXmG9uQCtSoGBz1).

**Note**: The video content is a work-in-progress and should be completed by mid-October 2019.
