[LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) is a powerful [WSYIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor
for LaTeX. I am an avid user of LyX since it allows for a highly productive environment for 
writing text and formatted math while continuing to allow for a high degree of customizability. 
LyX is an open source version of Scientific Workplace which is both more modern and has broader
compatibility with standard LaTeX.

LyX is cross platform and works equally well on Windows, Linux or OS X.

These videos comprise a basic introduction to LyX and cover the core tools needed to write a 
Thesis or paper in Economics or Econometrics (and many other fields, especially in mathematics, 
statistics or social sciences).

## Written Guidance

Some people prefer a written guide. Fortunately (for me), a good guide has been written 
(by others) and is available at [Lyx Guide](http://wiki.lyx.org/uploads/LyX/tutorials/essentials/LyX_Essentials.pdf).
