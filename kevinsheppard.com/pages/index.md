# Background

I currently work at the University of Oxford as a Financial Econometrician. 
My research focuses on volatility and uncertainty. Measuring and modeling 
conditional correlation, a key input into portfolio risk models is a 
cornerstone of my research.

I have produced a large volume of teaching resources, including a complete 
set of notes in [Financial Econometrics](/teaching/mfe/notes/), and introductions to both 
[Python](/teaching/python/notes/) and [MATLAB](/teaching/matlab/notes/). 
I also maintain a number of widely used toolboxes related to my research. The most
broadly used of these are the [MFE Toolbox for MATLAB](/code/matlab/mfe-toolbox), 
and the arch ([documentation](https://bashtage.github.io/arch/), 
<a href="https://github.com/bashtage/arch" aria-label="Visit the arch repository on Github"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>) 
and linearmodels ([documentation](https://bashtage.github.io/linearmodels/), <a href="https://github.com/bashtage/linearmodels" aria-label="Visit the linearmodels repository on Github"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>)
modules for Python. See my [GitHub page](https://github.com/bashtage) for a 
complete list of projects.
                
I enjoy hiking and being outdoors, although I don't get out as much as I 
would like. You can see some pictures of my adventures in the [gallery](/galleries/). 
I have a sweet but rambunctious chocolate labrador, [Callie](/galleries/Callie-(2015)/).
