      "title": "Scanning Documents for Online Tutorial and Exam Submission",
      "text": "You can also download a pdf version of this recommendation.\n\n\nFlatbed Scanners\nPhone and Tablet Scanning\nGeneral Instructions\nSoftware Recommendations\nAdditional Issues\n\n\n\n\nThis document describes how you can use your phone or tablet to produce clear scans of\nyour work as PDF files that are modest in size. The final section is written for Trinity\nTerm 2020 open-book test-takers since these students may be scanning documents under a\ntight time constraint. If you have any comments of know of software that works better,\nplease let me know at\nkevin.sheppard@economics.ox.ac.uk.\nFlatbed Scanners\u00b6\nIf you have access to a flatbed scanner, this will produce the highest quality scan. I\nrecommend you use 300dpi in black and white mode when scanning documents for submission.\nThis balances file size against the image's resolution. Grayscale and color generally\nproduce files that are larger and that are not usually easier for assessors or tutors to\nread. \nPhone and Tablet Scanning\u00b6\nGeneral Instructions\u00b6\nLighting\u00b6\nPoor lighting is the simplest method to produce a scan that is hard or impossible to\nread. Side lighting is key to creating a high-quality scan when using a phone or tablet.\nOverhead lighting is your enemy since it is likely that your body or your device will\ncast an unnecessary shadow. Look around your environment for locations that have a\nreliable source of side lighting. When scanning in the day, indirect outside light can\nproduce an excellent source for producing high-quality scans. Direct sunlight can lead\nto overexposure and is not recommended. Alternatively, you might find locations with\nunder cabinet lighting. I have good experience using these. Finally, a desk lamp can be\npositioned to produce side lighting where both you and your device will not case a\nshadow. If you do not have a good location with side lighting, you can use your device's\nflash. In my experience, this produces slightly worse quality scans than having a good\nlighting setup, but it is much better than having a shadow on your document. The image below\nshows a scan created with uniform lighting that originated from the side.\n\nTh next scan was created with a strong shadow that was produced by my arm. This tricked the\nsoftware into thinking that this was a color document.\n\nThis final scan was produced by Genius Scan. The device cast a strong shadow on the page\nwhich resulted in a large dark area.\n\nBackground\u00b6\nAssuming you are writing on white paper, you want to scan on a background that has high\ncontrast. Black, dark brown, and most other dark colors produce high contrast, which\nlets the software function better. The next image shows my preferred\nscanning location in my home. \n\nIt is a dark kitchen worktop which provides great\ncontrast. It is illuminated by under cabinet lighting, and so I cannot cast shadows with\nmy body or my device. Note that when scanning, I turn off the other lights in the\nkitchen so that the under-counter lights are the strongest source of illumination.\nDevice Position\u00b6\nIt is important that you hold your device level and that the document occupies the\nmajority of the viewfinder when scanning. Most high-quality scanning software will\nencourage optimal camera positioning.\nMulti-page Documents\u00b6\nMost documents you scan will consist of multiple pages. You should scan these\nconsecutively by adding a new page to your current scan. If you make a mistake, I\nrecommend reshooting the problematic page and then continuing to the end of the\ndocument. All of the recommended software lets you delete a page after you finish\nscanning.\nSoftware Recommendations\u00b6\niOS (iPad/iPhone)\u00b6\nThere are two apps I recommend: Genius\nScan (4.8 rating,\n35,000 reviews) and Scanner\nPro (4.9 rating\n130,000 reviews). Genius Scan is free and has a paid upgrade. It works well enough in\nthe free mode to use for exam and assignment submission. Scanner Pro has a modest price.\nBoth of these apps have great auto edge detection when used on a high contrast\nbackground. ScannerPro is more forgiving to uneven lighting and tends to produce softer\nshadows if present. ScannerPro is my recommendation if the price is not an issue.\nAndroid\u00b6\nGenius\nScan\n(4.7 rating, 78,000 reviews) is also available for Android and is, in my experience, the\nmost accurate scanner.\nCamScanner\n(4.8 rating, 2.5M reviews) also works well, although it is not as accurate at automatic\nedge detection. It does have some party trick modes that work well if you have a text\nthat is mostly monochrome text but contains a full-color diagram. Genius Scan is my\nrecommendation if you have a good lighting setup. If not, I would use CamScanner.\nThere are many other scanners, so please do try others if you are not happy with\nthese. \nGenius Scan Settings\u00b6\n\n\nSet Image Quality to medium before scanning your document (Menu > Settings > Image Quality > Medium).\n  I Could not detect any relevant differences when scanning black and white documents\n  across Medium, High, and Highest.  File sizes, however, do vary with this setting, and Medium\n  minimizes the output size of the PDF without compromising legibility.\n\n\nEdit images before exporting. After you have scanned the document, you can tap on any page to\n  open the edit view.  Editing lets you:\n\n\nAdjust the scanning mode to select Black & White if color incorrectly was detected;\n\nRotate the images so that they have the correct orientation; and\n\nRecrop any images where GeniusScan's edge detection was not adequate.\n\n\nChange the File size when exporting.  GeniusScan will estimate the size of the file after\n  export. In my tests, Small produced files that are easy to read (about 600kB per scanned page,\n  when used with Medium image quality). The table below shows the estimated size of the file\n  exported using combinations of Image Quality and File size.  Medium/Medium and Medium/Large\n  appear to be the most sensible choices. Both Highest Image Quality and Actual File size should\n  be avoided. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage Quality\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\nActual\n\n\n\n\nLow\n571kB\n640kB\n811kB\n2.1MB\n\n\nMedium\n1.2MB\n1.3MB\n1.7MB\n4.3MB\n\n\nHigh\n2.1MB\n2.3MB\n2.9MB\n7.5MB\n\n\nHighest\n3.6MB\n4.0MB\n5.1MB\n13MB\n\n\n\nI have included two sample files where you can compare\n   Highest/Actual with\n   Medium/Small. Note that the\n   file size of the Medium/Small file is 2.5MB, not 1.2MB, as estimated by GeniusScan. \nExcessively Large Scans\u00b6\nIf you attempt to export and the resulting file is excessively large, you can split a scan\nin GeniusScan. \n\nBegin by selecting the document.\nLong press a page in the second half of the document.\nSelect all pages in the second half.\nSelect the move icon and select New document.\n\nThe animation below illustrates these steps.\n\nYou will then need to rejoin the parts into a single PDF using PDF Sam Basic\nor an online tool.\nExcessively Large PDFs\u00b6\nIf the PDF you have produced exceeds the upload limit, you can compress it using\nan online PDF compressor.  I recommend using the\nmost conservative compression (Less Compression) which reduced scanned file sizes by 50% in \nmy experiments. \nAdditional Issues\u00b6\nI do not believe that at-home exam takers need to be overly concerned with carefully\nformatting their exam answers. If pressed for time, it is reasonable to refer a\nhand-drawn diagram or equation on another page. If you have time, your assessors will\nappreciate your efforts to produce an easier to read answer. If under time pressure and\nyou have two files, combining them into a Zip file before uploading.\nEmbedding Images in Documents\u00b6\nWhen writing essays, you may need one or more diagrams or one or more equations. The best\nformat (as in nicest for your tutor or assessor) is to embed the image into your word document.\nThe simplest method to do this is to:\n\ndraw your diagram;\nphotograph it;\ncrop it tightly on your device; and\nemail it to yourself, upload to a file service (Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive), or let a\n  service like Google Photos or iCloud to automatically back up the photo. You can encourage\n  Google photos to back up your images by opening the Google photos app.  The image will then\n  be available through your browser.\n\nYou should then be able to directly insert the equation or diagram into your document\nwithout further formatting.\nSnipping Tools\u00b6\nSnipping is a simple way to copy anything you can see on your computer into a Word\nor Google docs document.  You can snip just the content you want, and so should not \nneed to crop the image further.\n\nWindows 10: The preferred option is Snip and Sketch. The snipping window can be opened using\n  Win+Shift+S.\nWindows 7/8: These operating systems come with a program called Snipping Tool.\nmacOS: Command + Shift + 4 allows you to select a region to copy.\n\nCombining PDFs\u00b6\nYou may have assignments or exams that require mixed answers where some questions\nare standard essays, while others require more calculation. If your answer is\nspread between a Word document or a Google doc and a scanned PDF, you should combine\nthese into a single PDF before submission.\nThere are two simple methods. The first uses a web service appropriately titled\nCombine PDF. You can upload two or more PDFs, use\ndrag-and-drop to arrange their order, combine them, and then download them. This\nmethods comes with a standard disclaimer about privacy. Combine PDF states they delete\nall content after an hour, but they do not have a Privacy Policy visible.\n\nThe second uses PDF Sam Basic to merge them. PDF Sam is both\nfree to use and open source.  This program has to be locally installed to use. Merging\ntwo or more PDFs can be done by:\n\nselect merge;\nuse Add to add each of your files;\nselect the output pdf file; and\nclick on Run.",

      "title": "Economics and Management Interviews",
      "text": "I am a tutorial fellow at Keble College and interviewed Economics and Management applicants in December 2019 for entrance in 2020. This year we, along with many of my colleagues in other colleges and other subjects in Keble, made a conscious effort to interview more students from economically challenged backgrounds. In the Oxford admissions system, these candidates were classified as Band A and were typically in the bottom 10% of applicants based on a combination of socio-economic factors.\nWhile the interview is only one component of the application process, by the time students arrive at Keble for their interviews, it has substantial weight. The significant influence of the interviews occurs since all candidates have been filtered based on:\n\nGCSE;\ncontextualized GCSE;\nA-level subjects and predicted grades;\nPerformance on the TSA; and\nTheir reference and personal statements.\n\nThe TSA, in particular, is heavily relied upon to reject approximately 80% of candidates.  In general, only candidates in the top 20% were selected for interview. This year we were instructed to give serious consideration to Band A applicants in the top 80% of the TSA score distribution. We were also encouraged to consider Band B candidates. These candidates are outside the bottom 10% based on socio-economic indicators, but still relatively low. There was no specific target score for these applicants to receive an interview.\nAll applicants were interviewed at least twice.  My experiences here only refer to the applicant's economics interview. I found there was a wide range in the apparent level of preparation of the students. The lower socio-economic status students appeared to be meaningfully less prepared. Providing a channel to rectify this gap, as much as possible, is the ultimate motivation for this post.\nThe Interview\u00b6\nCandidates have two 20-minute interviews. The interview is content focused from the beginning. I had asked applicants to read a recent Journal of Economic Perspectives article that discusses some of the complexities of climate change policies. This article is written for a generalist audience, and there are not essential concepts that are covered in A-level Economics required to understand its core messages.\nWe then proceeded to discuss several issues related to the content, as well as some unseen information that I provided as part of the interview. I'm sharing the \"script\" for the interview so that students and teachers can understand the scope of the interview. The script is used to structure the discussion. It is not dogmatically followed since interviews are adapted to the applicant and their background. The supplemental data sheet is also available.\nQuestion 1\u00b6\nThe first question is a warm-up and is used to ensure that the applicant understands the data presented in Figure 1 of the reading. This is a marginal cost curve but is non-standard since the projects are different and many of the projects have negative costs.  The width of the bars demonstrates the project's capacity. The cumulative width of multiple projects is the capacity if all of the projects are implemented.  Some applicants did not fully grasp this final point and thought that the right edge of a project was the project's total capacity (beginning from 0).\nQuestion 2\u00b6\nThis question went deeper and examined whether applicants understood that this is a marginal cost curve.  It is sensible to produce carbon abatement using low-cost technologies first. Many focused on issues other than cost that were not discussed in the article.  It is vital that the material presented is fact-based, and in most cases, that it can be backed up by the facts contained in the paper. It was essential to show mastery of this question before\nproceeding to the next.\nQuestion 3\u00b6\nThis question relies on the  supplemental data sheet that is a simplification of Figure 1 in the\nprereading. \n\nThe total cost curve is a skewed U-shape that begins at zero, declines (but is convex) until 7, is flat from 7 to 8, and then increases from 8.  It crosses the zero around 14. Many applicants did not understand that total costs must start at 0 since you can always do nothing for no cost. Others did not synthesize the material and thought though that marginal cost was the total cost.\nQuestion 4\u00b6\nThis question is a fundamental math question. It assesses whether applicants have mastery of some basic concepts of calculus.  Almost all candidates could not define what a continuous function is (even heuristically, as in \"a function where I do not pick up my pencil\"). Some understood discontinuous function such as $y=tan(x)$, which has many singularities but did not grasp that a function does not need to have an unbounded range to be discontinuous. No one was familiar with continuously differentiable, and so we provided the definition. Most were not confident about how they would verify this. The two-component functions are both clearly continuous and continuously differentiable, and thus only the breakpoint needs to be checked. The question also uses the natural log ($ln$), which is heavily used in economics. Applicants are occasionally insufficiently familiar with the natural logarithm and its inverse, the exponential function.\nQuestion 5\u00b6\nQuestion 5 relies more on the reading and is used to establish a baseline.  Some applicants were not clear as to the fundamental distinction between a static and a dynamic cost: dynamic costs are realized on other projects.  For example, if the UK builds an offshore wind farm, some of the experience in building the wind farm can be used to reduce costs in future offshore wind farms. \nQuestion 6\u00b6\nQuestion 6 asks the applicants to apply their understanding of static and dynamic costs to electric vehicle charging points.  This question is challenging since there are arguably no static cost savings.  The static cost could be reasoned to be infinite if the number of tons of CO2 saved is 0. All, or the vast majority, of the cost, is dynamic since charging points encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.\nQuestion 7\u00b6\nQuestion 7 is open-ended. Applicants may discuss extended issues from the paper, such as the critical role uncertainty plays in dynamic costs or the estimated social cost of emissions.\nPreparing for an interview\u00b6\nInterviews in economics do not follow a single pattern.  Over the past ten years, I have used combinations of:\n\ncomplex logic puzzles that are ultimately applications of game theory;\nmath questions, especially using an approximation in graphical analysis to demonstrate an understanding of a topic\nreadings that can be deconstructed using economic analysis; and\ninterpretation of data (e.g., the trends in inequality over time, which I used in the past).\n\nThere is no single approach to preparing. My (admittedly generic) advice to prepare for an interview in Economics includes:\nThink like an economist - There are several core principals on which economists broadly agree.  A non-exhaustive list includes:\n\nThinking at the margin: what is the cost or benefit of a small change?\nOpportunity Cost: what do we need to give up to choose a particular course of action?\nComparative Advantage: how can two parties aggregate their opportunity costs to improve the outcome for both?\nCorrelation vs. causation: When can data or statistics be interpreted as causal rather than merely capturing a correlation?\n\nThese, and related, principles should be employed when structuring responses.\nBuild on facts - The reading should provide a solid basis for the subsequent discussion.  It is essential to emphasize the material in the passage that supports your point. It is equally crucial to not divert into a tangent that cannot be supported with the text, even if the alternative point may be valid. \nKnow your personal statement - You should be familiar with the details of your personal statement.  This is especially true of specific points you make about how events or readings have influenced your decision to pursue economics.\nPractice Practicing a wide range of problems is the best method to prepare for the uncertainty in an Economics interview. While the interview is not designed or intended to trip you up, the range of possible questions is wide.  \nThe most fruitful strategy is to prepare for as wide a range of problems as possible. This is the same advice I provide to candidates when they ask about the TSA: practice, practice, and then practice. Practice thinking about problems with little notice that do not have definitive answers. Candidates should ensure that they are comfortable communicating arguments verbally. Verbal communication of challenging concepts is not simple and requires practice. Most candidates are adept at producing written work. I have found that not all applicants are equally comfortable verbalizing their logic.  While the interview is not designed to trip up candidates, it is also not intended to be easy.  It is also not a competition in \"fact recollection.\" It is essential that candidates apply economic reasoning - not political, sociological, or philosophical - to the problem. Readings are chosen to provide a fact base that is sufficient to last the entirety of the interview. It is not usually necessary to introduce facts that are not readily verified.\nPerforming Well\u00b6\nThe interview is short and intense.  Candidates need to be ready to demonstrate their subject mastery and understand of the material. Anyone applying to Oxford must be able to communicate their ideas verbally.  Verbal communication is essential in the Oxford education system, where students spend hundreds of hours in small groups settings over their degree. Assessing the student's ability to communicate verbally, as well as to make reasoned arguments, is the justification of the interview.  I have performed interviews over many years. Not all 17-year-old applicants are in a place where they can take full advantage of Oxford's peculiar, labor-intensive, but effective method of teaching. My belief does not reflect on their intellect, their motivation, or their preparation. I do believe that an applicant's performance in an interview indicates whether they are ready to be placed into the unique setting of a tutorial.\nI have no doubts that all of the candidates I have been this year, whether we are in a position to offer them a place or not, will go on to great things.",

      "text": "DEPRECATED\nThe UCSD GARCH has been deprecated and will receive no further \nupdates. Recent changes in MATLAB have broken many of the functions in \nthe UCSD GARCH toolbox. Please use the MFE Toolbox which is the \nsuccessor to the UCSD GARCH toolbox.\n\nLegacy UCSD Toolbox\u00b6\n\n\nLegacy UCSD Toolbox\nHelp and Documentation\n\n\nLicense\n\n\nBefore reporting bugs, please be sure you have the\nlatest version, have downloaded the JPL toolbox, and ARE NOT using the\nucsd_garch code from the JPL toolbox (and don't have that directory on\nyour path)\nThe UCSD_Garch toolbox is a toolbox for Matlab that is useful in\nestimating and diagnosing univariate and multivariate heteroskedasticity\nin a Time Series models. The toolbox contains C-Mex files for the\nnecessary loops in the univariate models. It is being released under a\nBSD style [license]. This means you can do pretty much what ever you\nwant to including make money by selling it.\nDownload\nUpdates\u00b6\n2.0.14: Thanks for Mark Flood who pointed out an old bug in fattailed\ngarch. Even more reason to move to the MFE Toolbox if possible.\n2.0.13: Thanks for Mark Flood who pointed out an initialization bug in\nfull_bekk_simulate.\n2.0.12: Thanks to Dennis Turk who pointed out a bug in garchcore.m.\n2.0.11: I have updated the mex files to work with more modern versions\nof MATLAB and removed the 5.3 binaries. I also replaced the missing\ntarchcore.m so that all functions in the toolbox run with or without\nusing the binary files.\n2.0.10: New versions of bsds, bsds_studentized, block_bootstrap and\nstationary_bootstrap that use the latest version of Hansen's SPA paper\n2.0.9.: Quite a few bug/inconsistencies squashed thanks to Paul Koufalas\nand Lance Young\n2.0.8: 2 bugs in dcc_mvgarch and one in egarch squashed\n2.0.7: A few more bugs squashed thanks to Hansen Chen\n2.0.6: Fixed a couple of typos in the skewt garch functions\n2.0.5: Fixed a bug in vech()\n2.0.4: There is a Matlab limitation on filename length of 31 characters\non some versions. dagonal_bekk_mvgarch_likelihood was 1 character too\nlong. It has been renamed diagonalBekkMVgarchLikelihood.\n2.0.4: A bug was found in GARCHINMEAN. It is now fixed.\n2.0.3: A huge bug was found in EGARCH. The original file was using\nvariances, not std devs. This is now fixed. Not> I am unable to build\nthe 5.3 binary as I am out of the country. For now, egarchcore.dll is\nonly available for 6 and above.\nNote: A few last minute bugs have been caught and the toolbox has been\nfixed(Again!).

See the \nscreenshot below for an example of the experience of using VS Code. There \nis also an interactive console at the bottom left where commands can be \ndirectly executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImporting an exiting notebook into Magic Python\u00b6VS Code only understands Magic Python files as notebook-like documents, and so\n.ipynb files must be converted to use. The process of importing is simple:\n\nOpen a Jupyter notebook file\nClick on Import in the popup that appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExporting Magic Python to a Jupyter notebook\u00b6To export a Magic Python file, open the command palette and enter \"import jupyter\". \nSelect the option to import the notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter notebooks in PyCharm Professional\u00b6\nPyCharm Professional is my recommended approach if you are going to use Python\nthroughout the course. It provides the best experience and can be acquired for\nfree using the student program.\n\nPyCharm Professional has deeply integrated Jupyter Notebooks. To create\nan IPython notebook:\n\nOpen PyCharm Profession\nOpen the directory where your notebooks are stored\nRight-click on the root directory and select New > Jupyter Notebook.\nGive your file a meaningful name, and it will open in the main window.\n\n\nPyCharm uses a special syntax where cells look like code and so can be edited\nlike text. This allows PyCharm to use introspection and code completion on the\ncode you have written, a highly useful set of features. PyCharm stores the\nnotebook in a Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb), which means that you can\ntrivially open it in any other Jupyter notebook aware app.  This differs from\nVS code which stores the file as a play Python\nfile (.py) and requires an explicit export to a Jupyter notebook file.\nA code cell is demarcated using #%% and a markdown cell begins with #%% md.\nBelow is a screenshot of this notebook in PyCharm.\n\nMagic Python in PyCharm\u00b6PyCharm supports Magic Python cell execution. To use Magic Python, you need\nto enable Scientific Mode in the View menu. You can then use #%% to\nindicate the start and end of cells. Individual Cells can be executed in\nthe console by pressing CTRL+Enter.\n\nIn PyCharm, right-click on the root directory and select New > Python File. Give\nyour file a meaningful name.\n\nEnter\n#%%\nprint(\"This is the first cell\")\n\n#%%\nprint(\"This is not executed when the first cell is run\")\n\n\nEnable Scientific Mode in the View menu.\n\nRun the first cell by placing you mouse in the cell and pressing CTRL+Enter.\n\nRun the second cell by clicking on the Play button (arrow) that appears in the\ngutter of the editor.\n\n\n\nNote: Magic Python in PyCharm only supports python code, and so it is\nnot possible to mix Markdown text and Python in the same file.",

      "text": "Estimating the Risk Premia using Fama-MacBeth Regressions\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example highlights how to implement a Fama-MacBeth 2-stage regression to estimate factor risk premia, make inference on the risk premia, and test whether a linear factor model can explain a cross-section of portfolio returns. This example closely follows [Cochrane::2001] (See also [JagannathanSkoulakisWang::2010]). As in the previous example, the first segment contains the imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[1]:\n\n    \nfrom numpy import mat, cov, mean, hstack, multiply,sqrt,diag, \\\n    squeeze, ones, array, vstack, kron, zeros, eye, savez_compressed\nfrom numpy.linalg import inv\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2\nfrom pandas import read_csv\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the data are imported. I formatted the data downloaded from Ken French's website into an easy-to-import CSV which can be read by pandas.read_csv. The data is split using named columns for the small sets of variables and ix for the portfolios. The code uses pure NumPy arrays, and so values is used to retrieve the array from the DataFrame. The dimensions are determined using shape. Finally the risk free rate is forced to have 2 dimensions so that it will be broadcastable with the portfolio returns in the construction of the excess returns to the Size and Value-weighted portfolios. asmatrix is used to return matrix views of all of the arrays. This code is linear algebra-heavy and so matrices are easier to use than arrays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[2]:\n\n    \ndata = read_csv('FamaFrench.csv')\n\n# Split using both named colums and ix for larger blocks\ndates = data['date'].values\nfactors = data[['VWMe', 'SMB', 'HML']].values\nriskfree = data['RF'].values\nportfolios = data.iloc[:, 5:].values\n\n# Use mat for easier linear algebra\nfactors = mat(factors)\nriskfree = mat(riskfree)\nportfolios = mat(portfolios)\n\n# Shape information\nT,K = factors.shape\nT,N = portfolios.shape\n# Reshape rf and compute excess returns\nriskfree.shape = T,1\nexcessReturns = portfolios - riskfree\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next block does 2 things:\n\nCompute the time-series $\\beta$s. This is done be regressing the full array of excess returns on the factors (augmented with a constant) using lstsq.\nCompute the risk premia using a cross-sectional regression of average excess returns on the estimates $\\beta$s. This is a standard regression where the step 1 $\\beta$ estimates are used as regressors, and the dependent variable is the average excess return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[3]:\n\n    \n# Time series regressions\nX = sm.add_constant(factors)\nts_res = sm.OLS(excessReturns, X).fit()\nalpha = ts_res.params[0]\nbeta = ts_res.params[1:]\navgExcessReturns = mean(excessReturns, 0)\n# Cross-section regression\ncs_res = sm.OLS(avgExcessReturns.T, beta.T).fit()\nriskPremia = cs_res.params\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe asymptotic variance requires computing the covariance of the demeaned returns and the weighted pricing errors.

With some work, the estimator of this matrix can be seen to be\n\\begin{equation}\n G=E\\left[\\frac{\\partial g_{t}\\left(\\theta\\right)}{\\partial\\theta{\\prime}}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n-I_{n}\\otimes\\Sigma_{X} & 0\\\\\nG_{21} & -\\beta\\beta{\\prime}\n\\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{equation}where $X_{t}=\\left[1\\: f_{t}{\\prime}\\right]'$  and $\\Sigma_{X}=E\\left[X_{t}X_{t}{\\prime}\\right]$. $G_{21}$ is a matrix with the structure\n\\begin{equation}\nG_{21}=\\left[G_{21,1}\\, G_{21,2}\\,\\ldots G_{21,N}\\right]\n\\end{equation}where\n\\begin{equation}\nG_{21,i}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \n0_{K,1} & \\textrm{diag}\\left(E\\left[u_{i}\\right]-\\beta_{i}\\odot\\lambda\\right)\\end{array}\\right]\\end{equation}and where $E\\left[u_{i}\\right]$ is the expected pricing error.

To estimate the parameters, it is necessary to:\n\nProduce some starting values\nEstimate the parameters using (quasi-) maximum likelihood\nCompute standard errors using a \u201csandwich\u201d covariance estimator (also known as the [BollerslevWooldridge::1992] covariance estimator)\n\nThe first task is to write the log-likelihood which can be used in an optimizer. The log-likelihood function will compute the volatility recursion and the log-likelihood.

The asymptotic variance is estimated using the \u201csandwich\u201d form which is commonly expressed as\n$$\\mathcal{J}{-1}\\mathcal{I}\\mathcal{J}{-1}$$where $\\mathcal{J}$ is the expected Hessian and $\\mathcal{I}$ is the covariance of the scores. Both are numerically approximated, and the strategy for computing the Hessian is to use the definition that\n$$\\mathcal{J}_{ij}\\approx\\frac{f\\left(\\theta+e_{i}h_{i}+e_{j}h_{j}\\right)-f\\left(\\theta+e_{i}h_{i}\\right)-f\\left(\\theta+e_{j}h_{j}\\right)+f\\left(\\theta\\right)}{h_{i}h_{j}}$$where $h_{i}$ is a scalar \u201cstep size\u201d and $e_{i}$ is a vector of 0s except for element $i$, which is 1. A 2-sided version of this approximation, which takes both forward and backward steps and then averages, is below.

The notes require Python 3.6 or later, and all references to Python 2.7 have been removed.\nRemoved references to NumPy's matrix class and clarified that it should not be used.\nVerified that all code and examples work correctly against 2020 versions of modules. The notable packages and their versions are:\nPython 3.8 (Preferred version), 3.6 (Minimum version)\nNumPy: 1.19.1\nSciPy: 1.5.2\npandas: 1.1.1\nmatplotlib: 3.3.1\nIntroduced f-Strings in Section [subsec:f-Strings] as the preferred way to format strings using modern Python. The notes use f-String where possible instead of format.\nAdded coverage of Windowing function \u2013 rolling, expanding and ewm \u2013 to the pandas chapter.\nExpanded the list of packages of interest to researchers working in statistics, econometrics and machine learning.\nExpanded description of model classes and statistical tests in statsmodels that are most relevant for econometrics. Added section detailing formula support. This list represents on a small function of the statsmodels API. \nAdded minimize as the preferred interface for non-linear function optimization in Chapter [chap:Non-linear-Function-Optimization].\nPython 2.7 support has been officially dropped, although most examples continue to work with 2.7. Do not Python 2.7 for numerical code.\nSmall typo fixes, thanks to Marton Huebler.\nFixed direct download of FRED data due to API changes, thanks to Jesper Termansen.\nThanks for Bill Tubbs for a detailed read and multiple typo reports.\nUpdated to changes in line profiler (see Ch. [chap:performance-and-optimization])\nUpdated deprecations in pandas.\nRemoved hold from plotting chapter since this is no longer required.\nThanks for Gen Li for multiple typo reports.\n\nThird edition, Update 1\u00b6\n\nVerified that all code and examples work correctly against 2019 versions of modules. The\n   notable packages and their versions are:\nPython 3.7 (Preferred version)\nNumPy: 1.16\nSciPy: 1.3\npandas: 0.25\nmatplotlib: 3.1\nPython 2.7 support has been officially dropped, although most examples continue to work with 2.7.\n   Do not Python 2.7 in 2019 for numerical code.\n\nThird edition update\u00b6\n\nRewritten installation section focused exclusively on using\n    Continuum\\'s Anaconda.\nPython 3.5 is the default version of Python instead of 2.7. Python\n    3.5 (or newer) is well supported by the Python packages required to\n    analyze data and perform statistical analysis, and bring some new\n    useful features, such as a new operator for matrix multiplication\n    (@).\nRemoved distinction between integers and longs in built-in data\n    types chapter. This distinction is only relevant for Python 2.7.\ndot has been removed from most examples and replaced with @ to\n    produce more readable code.\nSplit Cython and Numba into separate chapters to highlight the\n    improved capabilities of Numba.\nVerified all code working on current versions of core libraries\n    using Python 3.5.\npandas\nUpdated syntax of pandas functions such as resample.\nAdded pandas Categorical.\nExpanded coverage of pandas groupby.\nExpanded coverage of date and time data types and functions.\n\n\nNew chapter introducing statsmodels, a package that facilitates\n    statistical analysis of data. statsmodels includes regression\n    analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and time-series analysis\n    using ARIMA models.\n\nSecond edition update\u00b6\n\nImproved Cython and Numba sections\nAdded sections discussing interfacing with C code\nAdded sections to the chapter on running code in Parallel covering\n    IPython\\'s cluster server and joblib\nFurther improvements in the installation based on feedback from the\n    Python Course\nUpdated Anaconda to 1.9\nAdded information about using Spyder as an initial IDE.\nAdded packages for Spyder to the installation instructions.\n\nNew in second edition\u00b6\n\nThe preferred installation method is now Continuum Analytics\\'\n    Anaconda. Anaconda is a complete scientific stack and is available\n    for all major platforms.\nNew chapter on pandas. pandas provides a simple but powerful tool to\n    manage data and perform basic analysis. It also greatly simplifies\n    importing and exporting data.\nNew chapter on advanced selection of elements from an array.\nNumba provides just-in-time compilation for numeric Python code\n    which often produces large performance gains when pure NumPy\n    solutions are not available (e.g. looping code).\nAddition to performance section covering line_profiler for\n    profiling code.\nDictionary, set and tuple comprehensions.\nNumerous typos fixed.\nAll code has been verified working against Anaconda 1.7.0.",

      "title": "Moving to Static Site Generation",
      "text": "This is the first post on my new site.  This site is a static site generated using Nikola, \na static-site generator written in Python. I chose it because I know Python pretty well and\nso can customize any feature I want. It also natively supports Jupyter Notebooks, which is \na big plus. \n\n\nWhile switching over I seriously considered Hugo, a generator\nwritten in Go which seems to have a very large and dedicated base. I may eventually switch \nover. Hugo although the Jupyter integration is nearly non-existent (i.e., manually export to\nmarkdown).\nThe Old Stack\u00b6\nThe good\u00b6\nFor many years I have used mediawiki as a Content Management System. \nI found this to be a relatively simple approach since it allowed be to create and populate a page\nwith links to other documents or files, whether these existed or not. If a page or file did \nnot exist, I could click on its link (which has a 404-color code) and either edit the missing\npage or add the file.  The wiki software also has a number of special pages that let me see\nall missing file.  As a bonus, MediaWiki indexes all content so that the site is immediately \nsearchable. There are many extensions that are helpful in integrating with other services,\ne.g., embedding YouTube videos. \nThe bad\u00b6\nWhat I didn't like about the old site was its fragility.  I regularly received emails telling \nme that my site was down.  These were driven by a connectivity issue with the MariaDB that stored\nthe site's data or with php-fpm which managed the relationship between the nginx front end\nand the PHP engine. My site depended on the correct operation of:\n\nnginx\nMariaDB\nphp-fpm\nMediaWiki\nA DigitalOcean droplet\n\nI also didn't like the feeling that I had to regularly patch the software. While I could setup\nUbuntu to automatically apply patches, I was always nervous about doing this with the MediaWiki\nsoftware. Instead, I would manually patch when I received an email from their security mailing list.\nIn addition, I had to occasionally migrate PHP versions when the current LTS increased its minimum\nsupported version. This was particularly challenging for me since I do not regularly use PHP and so \nI had to reinvent the wheel each time this happened (which I think was only twice, in fairness)\nThe extension landscape was also very uneven.  Many extensions I tried had no long-term support and \nso would continue to work until they used a feature that had been removed. This required repeatedly \nsearching for new extensions, and eventually lead me to remove most of them.  \nThe new site\u00b6\nThe good\u00b6\nThe new site is static in the sense that it is only a collection of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images\nand other content files.  The only server I need is a webserver (e.g., nginx). While I \nam initially hosting it on the same droplet I used for my MediaWiki installation, I plan \non moving to GitHub pages using Travis CI to build the pages.  This will both save my time and\nmoney.\nThe bad\u00b6\nWhile writing a simple site or pure blog is pretty food proof, Nikola is not a great site generator.\nThe biggest problems I have faced are (some) lack of out-of-box customizability, lack of\na theme I like, and nothing helping me ensure that I do not have missing or orphan pages.\nThe upside for me is that these are all pretty simple to fix writing a few custom plugins. \nFor example, I wrote one that reads the site contents, file a list of files and finds all\nlinks to these files.  It then uses a couple of set operations to determine if there are\nany missing files (really important) or orphan files (less important, but still annoying).",
